Making a final class called UserDefinedFunction to handle user created functions, 
making it open to the package only because anyone outside the package doesn't need to access/know about it

Using DoubleValues to send the value of a command to another command before it is known â€“ design flaw: unable to do 
recursion because this implementation passes in object references as parameters, but doesn't allow these object 
references to be changed, only their values, so a method can't be called inside of the same method without 
updating the parameters of the outside method as well.

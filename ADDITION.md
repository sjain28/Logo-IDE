SLogo Addition
=================

## Estimation: before looking at the old code:

##### How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
I believe it will take less than 2 hours maximum.

##### How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
I will need to add two new command classes to the commands package, because each command is its own class. In addition, I will need to update the `English.properties` file so that `SCALE` and `WINDOW` are valid commands. Finally, I will need to update the `Display` class so that it reflects the new scaling logic. Overall, this results in 4 classes added/updated.

## Review: after completing the feature:


##### How long did it take you to complete this new feature?



##### How many files did you need to add or update? Why?



##### Did you get it completely right on the first try?


## Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?


##### Was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?




##### What could be improved?





##### What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
